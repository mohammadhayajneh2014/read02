# why 
we need form to let users make something that allows the wibbages to do something  
- adding text 
- making choices
- submitting forms
- uploading files
# how 
## we can use form
+ A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
+ The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects 
+ The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database
+ The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received
